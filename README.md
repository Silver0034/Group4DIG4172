# HTML Prototype
**Freedom Pups**: Group 4, Milestone 2

## How to view
This is just an HTML prototype for our project. All of the links, images, and text are static and not final. To view our project, start by opening the [home.html](./home.html) file in your web browser. You should be able to see everything by clicking through the various links in the header or footer navigation.

Although it is not finished, the site is scalable and has a slightly different layout depending on the size of the device used to view it.
