				<h3><b>10 Facts about Puppy Mills</b> by dosomething.org</h3>
				<p>
					What exactly is a puppy mill? Why is it bad? 
					Here are 11 Facts as to why you should care about <u>Ending</u> puppy mills.
				</p>
				<ol id="factList">
					<li>
						A puppy mill is a commercial dog-breeding facility that focuses on profit. The health and welfare of the animals is not a priority.
					</li>
					<li>
						Female dogs are bred at every opportunity with minimum recovery time. When they are physically depleted to the point that they no longer can reproduce, breeding females are often killed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Every year in America, it is estimated that 2.11 million puppies are sold originated from puppy mills, while 3 million are killed in shelters because they are too full. 
					</li>
					<li>
						In puppy mills, dogs can spend most of their lives in cramped cages, with no room to play or exercise.
					</li>
					<li>
						Often times, the water and food provided for the puppies is contaminated, crawling with bugs. Puppies can even be malnourished.
					</li>
					<li>
						In most states, puppy mills are legal.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is estimated that there are at least 10,000 puppy mills in the U.S. while fewer than 3,000 of these are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
					</li>
					<li>
						Most puppy mills have no veterinary care, climate control, or protection for the animals from weather (hot, cold, rain, or snow).
					</li>
					<li>
						With limited or no regulations or enforcement, puppy mills have no cleanup control. This means that dogs can be living in urine and feces for indefinite periods of time.
					</li>
					<li>
						It's common to find dogs in puppy mills with collars that have been fastened so tightly that they have become embedded in a dog’s neck and must be carefully cut out.
					</li>
